\title{expected.het: Calculate Expected Heterozygosity from Genotype Data}
\usage{
expected.het(genotypes)
}
\arguments{
\item{genotypes}{A character vector containing genotype data, such as `"0|0"`, `"0/1"`, `"1|1"`, etc. The genotypes can be phased (`|`) or unphased (`/`).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing three elements: the allele frequency `p` of the dominant allele, the number of non-missing genotypes `n`, and the expected heterozygosity `Hexp`.
}
\description{
This function calculates the expected heterozygosity (Hexp) for a set of genotypes at a bi-allelic locus. Expected heterozygosity is a measure of genetic diversity and is based on allele frequencies.
}
\details{
The function first counts the occurrences of different genotypes using the `count.genotypes` function. It then calculates the total number of valid (non-missing) genotypes `n` and the allele frequencies `p` and `q` using the `allele.freq` function. The expected heterozygosity is computed as:

\deqn{H_{exp} = 2 \times p \times q}

Where `p` is the frequency of the dominant allele, and `q = 1 - p` is the frequency of the recessive allele.
}
\note{
The `count.genotypes` and `allele.freq` functions must be available in the user's environment.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
genotypes <- c("0|0", "0/1", "1|1", "./.")
result <- expected.het(genotypes)

# Output: [1] p (allele frequency), n (number of genotypes), Hexp (expected heterozygosity)

}
