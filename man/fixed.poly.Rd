\title{fixed.poly: Identify Fixed and Polymorphic Sites Between Two Populations}
\usage{
fixed.poly(vcf1, vcf2)
}
\arguments{
\item{vcf1}{A data frame representing the VCF data for the first population, where the first 9 columns contain metadata and the genotype data starts from the 10th column.}

\item{vcf2}{A data frame representing the VCF data for the second population, structured similarly to `vcf1`.}
}
\value{
A character vector indicating whether each site is "Fixed" or "Polymorphic" between the two populations.
}
\description{
This function identifies whether a genetic site is fixed or polymorphic between two populations based on allele frequencies calculated from their genotype data.
}
\details{
The function first extracts the genotype data (`GT`) from both VCF files using the `get.field` function. It then calculates allele frequencies (`p`) for each site in both populations using the `allele.freq` and `count.genotypes` functions. A site is considered "Fixed" if the absolute difference in allele frequencies between the two populations is exactly 1, and "Polymorphic" otherwise.
}
\note{
The `get.field`, `allele.freq`, and `count.genotypes` functions must be available in the user's environment for this function to work.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
vcf1 <- read.vcf("population1.vcf")
vcf2 <- read.vcf("population2.vcf")
result <- fixed.poly(vcf1, vcf2)

# Output: A vector indicating "Fixed" or "Polymorphic" for each site
