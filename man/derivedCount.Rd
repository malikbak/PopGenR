\title{derivedCount: Calculate Derived Allele Count from Genotype Data}
\usage{
derivedCount(row)
}
\arguments{
\item{row}{A vector representing a genetic variant, where the first 9 columns contain metadata, and the genotype data starts from the 10th column onward. The 9th column should contain the format string for genotype fields (e.g., `"GT"` for genotype).}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the derived allele count for the variant.
}
\description{
This function calculates the derived allele count for a given genetic variant based on its genotype data. The derived allele count is computed as twice the number of homozygous alternate genotypes (`aa`) plus the number of heterozygous genotypes (`Aa`).
}
\details{
The function extracts the genotype data (`GT`) from the `row` vector using the `get.field` function. It then uses the `count.genotypes` function to count the occurrences of `AA`, `Aa`, `aa`, and missing genotypes (`NN`). The derived allele count is computed as:

\deqn{\text{Derived Count} = (2 \times \text{aa count}) + \text{Aa count}}
}
\note{
The `get.field` and `count.genotypes` functions must be defined or available in the user's environment for this function to work.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
variant <- c("chr1", "12345", "A", "T", "...", "...", "...", "...", "...", "0/0", "0/1", "1/1")
derived_allele_count <- derivedCount(variant)
