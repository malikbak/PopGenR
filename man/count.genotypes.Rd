\title{count.genotypes: Count Genotypes from Genotype Data}
\usage{
count.genotypes(genotypes)
}
\arguments{
\item{genotypes}{A character vector containing genotype data in the form of `"0|0"`, `"0/1"`, `"1|1"`, etc. The genotypes can be phased (`|`) or unphased (`/`).}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector containing the counts of the genotypes `AA` (homozygous reference), `Aa` (heterozygous), `aa` (homozygous alternate), and `NN` (missing or unknown).
}
\description{
This function counts the occurrences of specific genotype patterns (homozygous reference, heterozygous, homozygous alternate, and missing data) from a vector of genotype strings.
}
\details{
The function first removes any phase (`|`) or unphase (`/`) symbols in the genotypes, normalizing the genotypes to simple two-character strings (`"00"`, `"01"`, `"10"`, `"11"`, or `".."`). It then counts the occurrences of each pattern. The heterozygous counts for `"01"` and `"10"` are combined into a single count for `Aa`.
}
\note{
The function returns a vector with counts for `AA`, `Aa`, `aa`, and `NN`, even if some genotypes are not present in the input.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
genotypes <- c("0|0", "0/1", "1|0", "1|1", "./.")
genotype_counts <- count.genotypes(genotypes)

# Output: named vector with counts for AA, Aa, aa, and NN
